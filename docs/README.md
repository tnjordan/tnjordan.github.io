# Experience

## Senior Data Scientist ~ Paccar
_Senior Data Scientist - May 2024 to present_\
_Data Scientist - September 2021 to May 2024_

Senior data scientist in Paccar's advanced analytics organization, with a proven track record of developing and deploying AI/ML-enabled models, managing data pipelines, and leading technical teams. I provide leadership as the lead data scientist on each project and by mentoring junior data scientists. By continually exploring the data for business insights, I am successful at identifying trends, anomalies, and opportunities to optimize decision-making. Through leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, I uncover actionable insights that drive efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance overall business strategy. Whether refining predictive models, improving data pipelines, or collaborating with stakeholders, my focus remains on transforming raw data into meaningful, high-impact solutions.


#### Data Science

  - Lead data scientist for Paccar Financial data science projects. Developed models from concept to deployment: predicting financial product rates, predicting sale prices, and identifying similar vehicles in inventory. Ran jira board, daily standups, sprint reviews, and presented quarterly results to executive stakeholders. Maintained existing model performance through data drift detection, retraining, and feature selection.

  - Invited by DAF to the Netherlands to run a workshop focused on data science and MLops best practices in order to accelerate the DAF analytics team's learning curve. In addition to delivering daily presentations, I led a team through the data science process to investigate root causes and enable early detection of a critical component failure.

  - Designed, organized, and lead workshops implementing end-to-end machine learning project pipelines. Starting with setting up GCP instances, fetching data from Snowflake, and then building models.  I then demonstrated how to build FastAPIs to provide model inference, use Docker to containerize the model and API, and how to deploy the API with CloudRun.  Finally, I demonstrated the process for building CICD pipelines in GitHub Actions to train, containerize and deploy the model, while versioning the project with git tags and DVC.

  - Conducted drive-train reliability analysis using Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox-PH) and Weibull distributions to develop a Monte Carlo simulation that modeled potential failures, helping to estimate business liabilities.


#### Machine Learning Operations
  - Developed CICD pipelines using GitHub Actions for all Paccar Financial models. Pipelines ran scheduled retraining to create a PR for user approval which would trigger model deployments and promotion to desired deployment environment. I wrote FastAPIs to provide model inference and containerized production code and models. Docker images were deployed to GCP or AWS.

  - Advised end-to-end design planning and reviews for external contractors working on other data science products. The warranty inference system design utilized Kafka streaming and a custom connector to call the models before logging and returning output. The pricing product's deployment was done using VertexAI.

  - Built logging into APIs and used GCP sinks to collect API logs in a bucket, which were then parsed and upload into Snowflake for performance evaluation dashboards in Tableau.

  - Trained MLops Engineer on existing deployments and team standards.  I continue to advise on new deployments as needed.  

#### Leader of Team

  - Review work done by junior members of team.
  - Review all code implemented for each product in Paccar's advanced analytics organization.
  - Set development standards for team.
  - Mentor associate data scientists on the team.
  - Lead weekly data science team discussion & debugging sessions
  - GitHub administrator for Paccar's advanced analytics organization.
  - Won 2022 and 2023 department hackathons; creating solutions for using data-streaming of truck data and building a Kafka stream to enhance truck build data before Snowflake archival respectively.
  - Develop and run annual data science workshop for Paccar's advanced analytics team.
